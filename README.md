# Legacy DOS Virtual Reality Project

This is a very old copy of source code of a virtual reality project that I wrote way back in the 90s. It was written using a version of Borland Turbo C with it's BGI graphics drivers used for drawing the 3d scene.

*Please note this code has a number of issues.* It was written about 1 year after I started learning C. There are a number of things in here I'd certainly avoid doing these days. The reason I have uploaded this code is that I currently only have a hardcopy of this program. Therefore I decided to scan it in and at least have a softcopy for my own personal amusement.

I have no current intention of making this code compile. The only further changes I expect to make will be to fix futher problems with the scanning of the hardcopy.

It should be noted that I did have a later version of this project. I'd resolved a number of bugs and written my own line and polygon drawing routines using ModeX. This meant that there was double-buffering to remove the flickering in this version. Sadly that version was lost.
